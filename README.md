# virtual-mixer

This virtual mixer project aims to simplify the process of routing audio on your windows machine.
The target audience here is anyone using voice meeter, but finds it a little lacking.

## Features i need :D

- Route audio from your audio input devices (microphones, instrument pick-ups, etc...)
- Route audio to your audio output devices (headphones, speakers, etc...)
- Route your desktop audio (audio from programs such as Spotify, a borwser, etc...)
- Turn a channel into an audio input device
      This creates a new microphone which other programs such as Discord can use as an input device
- No need for virtual audio cables

## Nice to have
- VST support (with some built-in, lightweight VSTs)
- Unlimited channels (until you run out of memory bassically)
- Channel presets
- Mixer presets
